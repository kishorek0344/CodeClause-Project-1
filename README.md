 # Project Title: Sentiment Analysis Tool



# Aim:
Develop a sentiment analysis tool that can determine the sentiment of a given text, categorizing it as positive, negative, or neutral.

# Description:
The Sentiment Analysis Tool will leverage sentiment analysis libraries or APIs, such as TextBlob, to evaluate the sentiment of user-provided text, such as sentences or reviews. By analyzing the textual data, the tool will identify and classify the sentiment, providing insights into the overall tone or emotional state expressed in the text. This project will involve implementing the tool in Python, utilizing pre-built sentiment analysis models to streamline the process and deliver accurate results.
